# WeatherApp
Developing a responsive front-end weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data based
on user-input city names. The app interacts with an external weather API to present key information such as
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in a clean, user-friendly interface. Implemented
error handling for invalid or empty inputs and integrated dynamic UI elements for enhanced user experience.
